# StructureReport
First attempt at creating a useful web application for structural engineers. A new repo has been created called client database management which is the second attempt at something like this.

Created using React, this was an attempt at making a full stack application and taught me a lot about creating readable code. A second attempt has been made in the form of a client database management application that the company desperately needed. Many mistakes were made here which I aimed to correct in the second attempt
